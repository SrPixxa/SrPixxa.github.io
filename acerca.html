                    <p>
                        My name is Cynthia Umaña, I’m Colombian and I once moved to the UK for  the love of my life. But
                        one
                        day. His love was gone and my darkest moments of my life started.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        After living with deep depression for 11 years, where I was so lost, so empty, unhappy, and at
                        the same
                        time, I created an eating disorder, where food was my escape, I was replacing that happiness
                        that has to
                        be inside us and created by us with sadness and an addiction to over eat to fill my empty space
                        in my
                        heart, a coping mechanism to forget about my pain. I was choosing to think and  live in the
                        past.
                    </p>

                    <p>In my past there was so much psychological abuse, rejection, insults and I was told how useless
                        and ugly I
                        was that I ended up believing it. And I forgot and abandoned the most important person who we
                        need to
                        love and cheer up and look after which is “ourselves”. I didn't have any self love and self
                        esteem.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It wasn't until I experienced my most painful moment in my life. That I started to realise that
                        these painful
                        moments are there to teach us a lesson. We can grow. Be stronger. And be wise for the rest of my
                        life.</p>

                    <p>I learnt that self love , forgive myself and others and leave the past where it belongs, and
                        choose very
                        wisely my thoughts was the recipe for happiness. And I am living the happiest I’ve ever been.

                    <p>I am the owner of my thoughts, and if I choose to be happy, I will, if I choose to only focus in
                        the present
                        and work for my dreams I can reach and make anything possible.</p>
