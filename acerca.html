                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Cynthia Umaña, I’m Colombian, mother of two
                        amazing children, 9 and 6 years old and I once moved to the UK for the love of my life. But one
                        day.
                        His love was gone and my darkest moments of my life started.
                        After living with deep depression for 11 years, where I
                        was so lost, so empty, so unhappy, so alone, and at the same time, I created an eating disorder,
                        where food was my escape, I was replacing that happiness that has to be inside us and created by
                        us
                        with sadness and an addiction to over eat to fill my empty space in my heart, a coping mechanism
                        to
                        forget about my pain. I was choosing to think and live in the past.
                        In my past there was so much psychological abuse,
                        rejections, insults and I was told how “useless” and “ugly” I was that I ended up believing it.
                        And
                        I forgot and abandoned the most important person who we need to love and cheer up and look after
                        which is “ourselves”. I didn’t have any self-love and self-esteem.
                    </p>

            <section class="container-mayor-section">
                <div class="container-mayor-section-div">

                    <p>It wasn’t until I experienced my most painful moment in my
                        life. This break up. A separation from the person I was so in love with. But who was also
                        hurting
                        me. And I was left in a country where I wasn’t born. With two children. And no other family
                        members
                        to offer any emotional help or company.
                        After my dramatic experience I realised that I was blaming
                        my ex, it wasn’t him hurting me, I was hurting myself, to stay and attach myself to the past and
                        to
                        not take control of my thoughts and life and I was only feeling a victim of the world. My ex
                        wasn’t
                        a villain and him and me just needed to take separated ways to grow as individuals, as a person
                        and
                        mentally get healthier and to become wiser people who love and respect themselves.
                        I learn to never depend on anyone in anyways and that the
                        person I need to fall in love with and work on, it is myself. I learnt that happiness is the way
                        how
                        we choose to see life as it comes. With good things and bad things. And that we have to know how
                        to
                        appreciate when good things happen but also to learn to cope in healthy ways and still be happy
                        while experiencing bad moments.

                <div class="container-mayor-section-div">
                    <p>I learnt that our most painful stories of life are there
                        to teach us a lesson, to make us wiser and strong. The past is a tool for as to use to create a
                        better version of ourselves. I learnt that self-love, forgive myself and others and leave the
                        past
                        where it belongs, and choose very wisely my thoughts were the recipe for happiness.

                        I am the owner of my thoughts, and if I choose to be
                        happy, I will, if I choose to only focus in the present and work for my dreams I can reach and
                        make
                        anything possible.
                        I learnt to look after my body, eat healthy and exercise
                        for me. Not for my ex or to look pretty for the world or for any other men. But only for me, to
                        please me and make myself happy and strong and have the best health and energy in the world for
                        me
                        and to be able to live the longest I can on this wonderful earth to be there for my kids to
                        guide
                        them and share the most amazing moments together.
                        I’ve learnt that to be a great mother I needed to give
                        them the best example of self-love and work on myself and show them that life is an amazing
                        place to
                        be where anything is possible.

            I learnt to have dignity and self-love to never be as
                        toxic as in my first years of relationship with my ex, which ended up in damaging his love and
                        therefore a relationship and that also created in him resentments that lead him to choose to
                        make
                        mistakes to me and hurt me. There is always two people who need to work on themselves first to
                        make
                        a relationship work. Being and feeling jealousy, controlling someone and seeing a person as your
                        possession will never end up good for anyone and you hurt yourself and others.
            
           
            
            </section>
            <section class="aside-div-container-section">12 <p>And I learnt that when someone wants to leave, we have to
                    let them go and with so much love. To set them free. Never insist, chase or beg or manipulate
                    anyone.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="aside-div-container-section">13 <p>I learnt that I can stay sad and cry for ever, and live
                    with guilt or blaming others or stand up and even with tears in my face but moving on. And one day
                    my tears become of joy because I believed in myself. I didn’t let the past abused or painful stories
                    stop me from seeing myself as the priority. To never beg, chase or insist someone to love me or stay
                    with me. That the person I need to look after and make happy is myself.</p>
