                    <p>
                        My name is Cynthia Umaña, I’m Colombian and I once moved to the UK for  the love of my life. But
                        one
                        day. His love was gone and my darkest moments of my life started.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        After living with deep depression for 11 years, where I was so lost, so empty, unhappy, and at
                        the same
                        time, I created an eating disorder, where food was my escape, I was replacing that happiness
                        that has to
                        be inside us and created by us with sadness and an addiction to over eat to fill my empty space
                        in my
                        heart, a coping mechanism to forget about my pain. I was choosing to think and  live in the
                        past.

                    <p>In my past there was so much psychological abuse , rejection, insults and I was told how useless
                        and ugly I
                        was that I ended up believing it. And I forgot and abandoned the most important person who we
                        need to
                        love and cheer up and look after which is “ourselves”.  I didn’t have any self love and self
                        esteem.

                    <br>
                    <p>It wasn’t until I experienced my most painful moment in my life. That I started to realise that
                        these painful
                        moments are there to teach us a lesson. We can grow. Be stronger. And be wise for the rest of my
                        life.</p>

                        wisely my thoughts was the recipe for happiness. And I am living the happiest I’ve ever been.

                    <p>I am the owner of my thoughts, and if I choose to be happy, I will, if I choose to only focus in
                        the present
                        and work for my dreams I can reach and make anything possible.</p>

            I learnt to have dignity and self-love to never be as
                        toxic as in my first years of relationship with my ex, which ended up in damaging his love and
                        therefore a relationship and that also created in him resentments that lead him to choose to
                        make
                        mistakes to me and hurt me. There is always two people who need to work on themselves first to
                        make
                        a relationship work. Being and feeling jealousy, controlling someone and seeing a person as your
                        possession will never end up good for anyone and you hurt yourself and others.
            
           
            
            </section>
            <section class="aside-div-container-section">12 <p>And I learnt that when someone wants to leave, we have to
                    let them go and with so much love. To set them free. Never insist, chase or beg or manipulate
                    anyone.</p>

            <section class="aside-div-container-section">13 <p>I learnt that I can stay sad and cry for ever, and live
                    with guilt or blaming others or stand up and even with tears in my face but moving on. And one day
                    my tears become of joy because I believed in myself. I didn’t let the past abused or painful stories
                    stop me from seeing myself as the priority. To never beg, chase or insist someone to love me or stay
                    with me. That the person I need to look after and make happy is myself.</p>
