                <p>1️⃣ After having a deep depression for 11 years, and an eating disorder, feeling so sick
                    all the time in a bed, never looking after my body, choosing the most toxic foods, day
                    and night, to pretend a smile on my face to keep my life with my children going in the
                    middle of so much pain and sadness, to not be able to look for a job, because I was
                    so scared, shy, I felt useless and lost, I didn’t have trust in myself and no confidence
                    so I couldn’t keep any job anyway.

                <p>
                    2️⃣ I didn’t even know what I wanted, I was so empty, I didn’t love anything, I couldn’t get
                    out of my bed or house. I couldn’t look at people in the eyes. Because I felt so little,
                    so unimportant. All the rejections, insults and my traumatic experiences in the past
                    were in my thoughts all the time, and I was choosing to live in this past. And it was
                    consuming and stopping me from living in the present. Which is where we need to
                    put our focus on.

                    3️⃣ And after all these, I am now the <span class="highlight">happiest I’ve ever been</span>,
                    writing books, being
                    independent, having my own business, loving life and myself.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I went back to study, to gain knowledge and work on myself. I know that if I’m happy,
                    my loved ones will be too.

                    4️⃣ And I’m telling you all this, because it doesn’t matter what happened to yourself in
                    the past,<span class="highlight"> there is hope!</span>, we can be happy!.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I can help you to defeat all this darkness and sadness. To overcome past stories and
                    to move on and learn to cope in healthy ways the stressful and difficult moments in
                    life.
